    <string name="privacy_policy_data">This Privacy Policy describes the information collected by
        Nevexa Digital Private Limited. d/b/a www.xappie.com, (“Xappie”, “us”, “we” “our”),
        how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about
        such uses and disclosures. By using the website http://www.xappie.com (the “Site”)
        and the services, features, content, applications or widgets, as well as mobile
        device applications offered by Xappie (collectively with the Site, the “Services”),
        you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Policy forms
        an integral part of Xappie’s Terms of Service, which is incorporated by reference.
        Any capitalized term used but not defined in this Policy will have the meaning defined
        in the Terms of Use. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the Services.\n\n
The Information Xappie May Collect

\n\n1. Information You Provide\n
Xappie may collect and store any personal information you enter through the Services or the Site.
        This may include personally identifying information, such as your name, username, residence,
        e-mail address, birthdate, pictures, and/or credit card information. Xappie may also request
        information about your interests and activities, and location. No system can be completely secure.
        Therefore, Xappie does not promise, and you should not expect, that such information may not be
        inadvertently collected and that such personal information will remain secure.

\n\nYou also may give us permission to access your information on other services.
        If you connect to the Services using your Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn,
        Instagram or other third-party service credentials (each, a “Supported Platform”),
        you authorize us to collect your authentication information, such as your username,
        encrypted access credentials, and other information that may be available on or through
        your Supported Platform account, including but not limited to your name, pictures,
        and friends/followers lists. The information we get from Supported Platforms may depend
        on your settings or their privacy policies.

\n\nXappie does not store any user financial information, even though we may request information
        about you and your credit card and/or bank account. Xappie does not store certain financial
        data due to its use of third party agents, such as PayPal, as its financial transaction facilitator.
        Please refer to such third parties\' Terms (https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full)
        and Privacy Policies (https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full) for more information
        about how these parties use your information. We do not store any user financial information,
        even though we may request information about yourself and your credit card and/or bank account.
        That financial information is handled, processed, and stored by the third party financial transaction processing companies.
        To the extent that Xappie uses third party providers such as PayPal for financial transaction services,
